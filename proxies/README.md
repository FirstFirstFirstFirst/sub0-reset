Sacha asked me what is like the coolest this I have seen in a while.
The one thing that excites me is the smart accounts or EIP-7702.

Proposed by Vitalik, this EIP is a game changer.
It basically allows users to set smart contract code for their account.


## How so do you have a smart accounts on this Polkadot thing?

Yes. - it is called proxy.


## The task

Your task is to pump you token with proxy accounts.

Your script has to contain:
1. Creation of a pure proxy account
2. Usage of EOA as a proxy
3. Usage of call via as_derivate
