## Multisend?

My friend Viki has a problem, he wants to send all his ERC-20s and NFTs from an
old wallet into the new wallet.

He has two types of wallet

- one created with metamask
- one is an smart contract wallet (argent)

**Q how would you help him?**

## Chain of thought

What I need to do?

As an EVM developer I have basically a few options

**1. Write a script**

I can write a script that will send all the tokens from one wallet to another.

Pros:

- He will know what is going to happen

Cons:

- Many transaction signatures
- Lot of gas consumed

**2. Write a smart contract**

Basically I can write the same thing as a smart contract. However, batch can be
done in a single transaction.

Pros:

- Less gas consumed
- Just one transaction

Cons:

- I need to deploy SC
- Still need to do approval or sign permits

**3. Multicall/Multisend**

Does what would Viki need.

Pros:

- Just one transaction
- Exacly what Viki needs

Cons:

- Not all wallets support it
- Transaction builder only available for Safe wallet
- have you seen the code? ðŸ˜­

**4. Just EIP-5792 bro**

Ethereum has new EIP-5792 that allows you to do batch calls. Perfect use case
for this.

Pros:

- All you need in one transaction
- Easy to compose a transaction list via `wagmi`

Const:

- Needs to be supported both by wallet and chain/RPC provider
- Limited amount of wallets

## How so do you have a multicall on this Polkadot thing?

Yes. - 3 types

- batch
- batch_all
- force_batch

Can I use the batch calls in Solidity?
[Yes, on moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/batch/#find-a-contract-interactions-call-data)

## The task

Your task is to write a code that will mint one token, one nft from one address
and sends it to another address in one transaction.

> [!IMPORTANT] make sure you have generated private key via `pnpm generate` and
> have it in your `.env`

Your script has to contain:

1. Create an NFT collection on nfts pallet
2. Mint a NFT using nfts pallet in that collection
3. Send both to another address
4. create system.remark with following format: task_multicall/address

### Notes

Part of the implementation is in `config/calls.ts` file. Implement them first so
you can use them in your script.

## I feel like I need more

### Polkadoot let's gooo

Writing/Hacking: Try to come up with a new use case for batch calls in Polkadot.

### I speak Solidity

Implement batch calls in Solidity. You can either use approaches above or come
up with your own.
