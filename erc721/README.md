## They see me ERCink!

ERC-721 is a standard for NFTs on Ethereum and practically any other ecosystem took it as a standard "interface" for NFTs (except Solana OFC).
My friend Frank wants to deploy his own NFT collection on Polkadot and he is asking me about ERC-721 here.*

**Q how would you help him?**

## Chain of thought

What I need to do? 
Need to update the contract with new metadata URI.

## How so do you have an ERC-721 for NFTs on this Polkadot thing?

Well, yes but it needs some love from you <3

## The task

Your task is to write an ERC-721 contract in ink! for Polkadot with a following functionality:
1. Create an ink! smart contract that would represent ERC-721
2. have an onchain metadata (returing a JSON string)


Your script has to contain:
1. Deploy of the smart contract
2. Create a collection on nfts pallet
3. Set metadata, max supply and permission to mint publicly for 0.1 PAS
4. Write a code to mint a token
